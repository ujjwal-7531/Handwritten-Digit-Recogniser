# Handwritten-Digit-Recogniser

MNIST Handwritten Digits dataset is used for training and testing the model.<br>
The zip-file contains the datasets in csv format.<br>
The model uses knn-classifier to classify digits(0-9)<br><br>
1. main1:<br>
   For feature engineering, I have used Keras' ImageDataGenerator to augment the images.<br>
   Parameters-Used: rotation_range, height_shift_range, zoom_range, shear_range.<br>
   Here i haven't calculated accuracy score.<br><br>
2. main2:<br>
   I have used k as 3(as model was more accurate for k=3.<br>
Thankyou (^_^)
